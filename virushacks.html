<h3>Email Viruses</h3>
<p><u>ILOVEYOU</u></p>
<p>
    Sends an email with the subject ILOVEYOU with an attachment that claims it is a love letter specifically for you. The attachment often has a .vbs extension.
</p>
<p><u>Melissa Virus</u></p>
<p>
    Sends an email with the subject that includes the words “Important message from” or "Urgent" that includes an attachment that has a .vbs extension.

</p>
<p><u>MyDoom</u></p>
<p>
    Subject of the emails contains some form of “Error”, “Mail Delivery Test”, or an indication of failure. Often contains in the actual email the line: “Andy; I’m just doing my job, nothing personal, sorry”. Will avoid sending email to .edu addresses.
</p>
<p><u>SoBig</u></p>
<p>
    Subject of the email makes it look like it is in response to another email or something important. (Ex. Re: Thank you! Re: Your application, Urgent, Re: Movie). The attached file can have a variety of obscure file extensions.
