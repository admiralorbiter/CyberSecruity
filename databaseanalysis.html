<p>
    Below is a network of computers. We need to find the path the virus took from Node 0 to Node 7. Each connection shows a firewall strength betweeen 2 computers.<br>
    For instance the strength of the firewall between Computer (Node) 0 and Computer (Node) 1 is 5. The virus would take the path that would have the least <b><u>total</u></b> strength between Computer 0 and Computer 7.
